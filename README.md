# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Intentions of this project:
- Practice with a couple of libraries (time and random)
- Work on improving the cleanliness and organization of my code
- Practice loops (ability to decide on a number of rounds)
- Practice handling user inputs (value errors, try / except)

This is a basic script that has the user play rock, paper, scissors against the program. The user is asked how many rounds they want to play and are then able to choose one of the three options each round. Using the random library the program randomly picks one of the three possible choices to play against the users option. The script will count up the number of wins, losses and ties to determine who won, and will respond to the user with a list of different quotes, making the program a little different each time the user plays.
